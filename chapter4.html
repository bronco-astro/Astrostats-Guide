  <main>

    <p>
      Probability distributions describe how values of a measurement are spread.
      Instead of focusing on a single observation, distributions describe what
      happens when the same measurement is repeated many times.
    </p>

    <p>
      In astronomy, distributions are used to model photon counts, measurement
      errors, detection results, and similar quantities.
    </p>

    <p>
      A distribution is a model. It does not describe reality exactly, but it
      captures the main behavior of the data.
    </p>

    <h2>Discrete and continuous measurements</h2>
    <p>
      Some measurements take only whole-number values, such as the number of
      photons detected or the result of repeated detection attempts. These are
      described using discrete probability distributions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other measurements vary smoothly over a range of values, such as brightness
      or distance. These are described using continuous probability distributions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The type of measurement determines which distribution is appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>The binomial distribution</h2>
    <p>
      The binomial distribution is used when a measurement is repeated a fixed
      number of times, and each repetition has only two possible outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples include detection versus non-detection.
    </p>

    <p>
      The probability of observing exactly k successes is
    </p>

    <pre>
P(k) = ( n choose k ) p^k (1 − p)^(n − k)

( n choose k ) = n! / [ k! (n − k)! ]
    </pre>

    <h2>The Poisson distribution</h2>
    <p>
      The Poisson distribution describes how many times something happens within
      a fixed interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      In astronomy, it is often used to model photon counts during an exposure.
    </p>

    <p>
      The probability of observing k occurrences is
    </p>

    <pre>
P(k) = ( λ^k e^(−λ) ) / k!
    </pre>

    <p>
      This distribution is commonly used when occurrences are independent and
      happen at a constant average rate.
    </p>

    <h2>The normal distribution</h2>
    <p>
      The normal distribution, also called the Gaussian distribution, is often
      used to describe measurement errors.
    </p>

    <p>
      It appears when many small effects contribute to uncertainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      The probability density function is
    </p>

    <pre>
f(x) = (1 / (σ √(2π))) exp[ − (x − μ)² / (2σ²) ]
    </pre>

    <p>
      The normal distribution is symmetric around its center.
    </p>

    <h2>Comparing the distributions</h2>
    <p>
      The binomial distribution is used when the number of trials is fixed and
      outcomes are limited to two possibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Poisson distribution is used when counting how many times something
      occurs in a fixed interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      The normal distribution is used for continuous measurements.
