  <main>

    <p>
      This chapter is about data that describe locations in space.
      Instead of measuring values at fixed points, the data consist of
      positions of objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      In astronomy, this usually means positions of stars, galaxies,
      clusters, or detected events on the sky.
      The goal is to understand spatial patterns rather than individual measurements.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes spatial data different</h2>
    <p>
      Spatial data describe where objects occur.
      The positions are often not independent.
      Objects may cluster together or avoid each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Methods that assume independence cannot describe this behavior.
      Spatial point processes provide tools to analyze these patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Point patterns</h2>
    <p>
      A point pattern is a set of locations in space.
      Each point represents one object.
      The pattern may appear random, clustered, or regularly spaced.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plotting the points is always the first step,
      but visual inspection alone is not enough.
    </p>

    <h2>Complete spatial randomness</h2>
    <p>
      Complete spatial randomness is a reference idea.
      Under this assumption, points occur independently and uniformly over space.
    </p>

    <p>
      This model is often used as a baseline for comparison.
    </p>

    <h2>Poisson point process</h2>
    <p>
      The Poisson point process is the simplest spatial point process.
      Points occur independently, and the number of points in a region
      follows a Poisson distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The average density is constant over space.
      This process is commonly used as a null model.
    </p>

    <h2>Intensity function</h2>
    <p>
      The intensity function describes how point density varies over space.
      It gives the expected number of points per unit area.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, intensity is constant.
      In other cases, it changes with position.
    </p>

    <h2>Inhomogeneous Poisson processes</h2>
    <p>
      Many astronomical datasets are not uniform.
      Inhomogeneous Poisson processes allow intensity to vary across space.
    </p>

    <p>
      This variation may come from physical structure or observational effects.
    </p>

    <h2>Clustering and interaction</h2>
    <p>
      Not all spatial patterns can be explained by intensity alone.
      Some point processes include interaction between points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Points may attract each other or repel each other,
      leading to clustering or regular spacing.
    </p>

    <h2>Ripley’s K function</h2>
    <p>
      Ripley’s K function is a common tool for studying spatial clustering.
      It measures how many points lie within a given distance
      of a typical point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deviations from random expectations indicate clustering or inhibition.
    </p>

    <h2>Pair correlation function</h2>
    <p>
      The pair correlation function describes how point density changes with distance.
      It provides a local view of clustering.
    </p>

    <p>
      This method helps identify characteristic spatial scales.
    </p>

    <h2>Edge effects</h2>
    <p>
      Spatial analysis is affected by boundaries of the observation region.
      Points near edges have fewer neighbors within the observed area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Edge correction methods are needed to avoid bias.
    </p>

    <h2>Marked point processes</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes each point has additional information, called a mark.
      Marks may represent brightness, mass, or other properties.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marked point processes study how marks relate to spatial structure.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications in astronomy</h2>
    <p>
      Spatial point processes are used to study galaxy clustering,
      star-forming regions, and distributions of detected events.
    </p>

    <p>
      These methods help separate random structure from physical patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Limits of spatial methods</h2>
    <p>
      Results depend on assumptions about the observation region
      and the underlying process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Incomplete coverage and selection effects can bias results.
      Interpretation requires care and physical understanding.
