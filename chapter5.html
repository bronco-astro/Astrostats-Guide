    <p>
      Nonparametric methods are used when data do not follow a known probability
      distribution. Instead of assuming a specific functional form, these methods
      rely more directly on the data itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      In astronomy, data often violate ideal assumptions. Measurements may be
      noisy, skewed, censored, or contain outliers. Nonparametric methods are
      useful in these situations because they make fewer assumptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Why nonparametric methods are needed</h2>
    <p>
      Many statistical methods assume data follow a specific distribution, such
      as the normal distribution. In real astronomical data, this assumption is
      often not valid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nonparametric methods avoid strong assumptions about distribution shape.
      They are more flexible and often more robust when working with real
      observations.
    </p>

    <h2>Ranks instead of values</h2>
    <p>
      A key idea in nonparametric statistics is the use of ranks instead of actual
      values.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data points are ordered from smallest to largest, and analysis is performed
      using their positions in the ordered list. This reduces sensitivity to
      extreme values and measurement errors.
    </p>

    <h2>Empirical distribution function</h2>
    <p>
      The empirical distribution function describes the distribution of observed
      data directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      It increases step by step as data values increase. Each step corresponds to
      one observation. This function provides a nonparametric estimate of the
      cumulative distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The empirical distribution function converges to the true distribution as
      more data are collected.
    </p>

    <h2>Sample quantiles</h2>
    <p>
      Quantiles describe positions within a dataset. The median divides the data
      into two equal parts. Other quantiles divide the data into more parts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quantiles are nonparametric summaries because they do not depend on any
      assumed distribution. They are useful for skewed data and data with
      outliers.
    </p>

    <h2>The sign test</h2>
    <p>
      The sign test is a simple nonparametric method for testing whether a
      distribution is centered around a specific value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only the direction of deviation matters, not the size. This makes the test
      robust but less sensitive than parametric alternatives.
    </p>

    <h2>The Wilcoxon tests</h2>
    <p>
      Wilcoxon tests use ranks to compare data sets.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used for paired data.
      The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is used to compare two independent samples.
    </p>

    <h2>Correlation without assuming linearity</h2>
    <p>
      Nonparametric correlation measures describe relationships between variables
      without assuming a linear relationship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rank-based correlation measures detect monotonic relationships and are less
      sensitive to outliers.
    </p>

    <h2>Two-sample comparisons</h2>
    <p>
      Nonparametric methods are often used to compare two samples when their
      distributions are unknown or unequal.
    </p>

    <p>
      These methods test whether two samples come from the same underlying
      distribution without specifying its shape.
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Nonparametric methods are robust and flexible. They work well with small
      sample sizes and non-normal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, they may discard some information and can be less efficient when
      parametric assumptions are actually valid.
