  <main>

    <p>
      Multivariate analysis deals with data that contain more than one variable for
      each observation. In this chapter, many variables are considered at the same time.
      We use PCA to group variable and test their influence. And then ICA to separate. For instance, 
      ICA can be used to seperate different audio sources to find hidden message.
    </p>

    <h2>Why multivariate methods are needed</h2>
    <p>
      Looking at one variable at a time can hide structure in the data.
      Some patterns only appear when several variables are considered together.
      Multivariate methods help describe these relationships in multi-dimensional spaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Multivariate data as points</h2>
    <p>
      Each observation can be viewed as a point in a space with many dimensions, where
      each dimension corresponds to one variable. A dataset becomes a cloud of points
      in this multi-dimensional space. Multivariate methods is used to summarize and
      understand the shape of this cloud better.
    </p>

    <h2>Covariance between variables</h2>
    <p>
      Covariance measures how two variables vary together.
      If large values of one variable tend to occur with large values of another,
      the covariance is positive. And vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      For two variables x and y, the sample covariance is
    </p>

    \[
      \mathrm{Cov}(x, y) =
      \frac{1}{n-1}
      \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})
    \]

    <p>
      Covariance depends on the scale of the variables, which can make it difficult
      to compare across different units.
    </p>

    <h2>Correlation</h2>
    <p>
      Correlation is a scaled version of covariance.
      It removes units and limits values to lie between −1 and 1, which makes
      interpretation easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sample correlation coefficient is
    </p>

    \[
      \mathrm{Corr}(x, y) =
      \frac{\mathrm{Cov}(x, y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}
    \]

    <p>
      where \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_y\) are the standard deviations of x and y.
    </p>

    <h2>The covariance matrix</h2>
    <p>
      When working with many variables, covariances are transformed into a covariance matrix.
      For p variables, the covariance matrix is a p × p matrix. Diagonal elements contain
      variances, and off-diagonal elements contain covariances between different variables.
    </p>

    <h2>Principal component analysis (PCA)</h2>
    <p>
      Principal component analysis is a widely used multivariate technique.
      PCA finds new variables, called principal components, that are linear combinations
      of the original variables. These components are chosen to capture as much variance
      as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first principal component captures the largest possible variance. Each following
      component captures the largest remaining variance under the constraint of being
      orthogonal to previous components.
    </p>

    <h2>PCA and eigenvalues</h2>
    <p>
      Mathematically, PCA is based on the covariance matrix.
      Principal components are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem
    </p>

    \[
      \Sigma \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
    \]

    <p>
      where \(\Sigma\) is the covariance matrix, \(\mathbf{v}\) is an eigenvector,
      and \(\lambda\) is the corresponding eigenvalue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eigenvectors define the directions of the principal components. Besides, it measures
      how much variance is explained by each component.
    </p>

    <h2>Dimension reduction</h2>
    <p>
      Multi-dimensional data are difficult to visualize and analyze.
      PCA is often used to reduce the number of variables by keeping only the first few
      principal components. These components usually explain most of the variance in the dataset.
    </p>

    <h2>Scaling and standardization</h2>
    <p>
      Variables often have different units and ranges.
      Before applying PCA, data are often standardized so that
      each variable has mean zero and standard deviation one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without scaling, variables with large numerical ranges can dominate the results.
    </p>

    <h2>Limits of multivariate methods</h2>
    <p>
      Multivariate techniques are powerful but sensitive to noise, outliers, and preprocessing choices.
      Interpretation becomes harder as the number of variables increases. Therefore, it is important to understand 
      each principal component before making any further step.
