  <main>

    <p>
      Time series analysis is about data collected over time. In astronomy, this
      usually means observing the same object many times and recording how a
      quantity changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples include light curves, radial velocity measurements, or count rates.
      In time series data, the order of observations matters.
    </p>

    <h2>Why time series are different</h2>
    <p>
      In time series data, measurements close in time are often related.
      This means data points are not independent. Many methods from earlier
      chapters assume independence, so they do not apply directly here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time series analysis focuses on understanding and modeling this time dependence.
    </p>

    <h2>First step: look at the data</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing to do is always to plot the data against time.
      Plotting helps identify trends, sudden changes, gaps, outliers,
      and possible periodic behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>Trends and variability</h2>
    <p>
      A time series often contains both trends and variability.
      A trend is a slow change over time, such as a gradual increase or decrease.
      Variability refers to fluctuations around a typical level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Removing trends is often necessary before modeling short-term behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>Stationarity</h2>
    <p>
      Many time series models assume stationarity. A stationary time series has
      statistical properties that do not change with time. The mean and variance
      stay roughly constant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Real astronomical time series are often not stationary. Transformations such
      as differencing are used to make data closer to stationary.
    </p>

    <h2>Autocorrelation</h2>
    <p>
      Autocorrelation measures how similar the data are to themselves at different
      time lags. If values close in time are similar, autocorrelation at small lags
      is large.
    </p>

    <p>
      Autocorrelation describes memory in the data and is a key idea behind many
      time series models.
    </p>

    <h2>ARIMA models</h2>
    <p>
      ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average.
      ARIMA models describe time series using past values, past errors,
      and differencing.
    </p>

    <p>
      An ARIMA model is written as ARIMA(p, d, q).
    </p>

    <h2>Autoregressive (AR) part</h2>
    <p>
      The autoregressive part models the current value using previous values.
      In an AR model, the value at time t depends on values at earlier times.
    </p>

    <p>
      The parameter p specifies how many past values are used.
      Larger p means longer memory.
    </p>

    <h2>Integrated (I) part</h2>
    <p>
      The integrated part refers to differencing the data.
      Differencing removes trends and helps make the time series stationary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The parameter d specifies how many times differencing is applied.
    </p>

    <h2>Moving average (MA) part</h2>
    <p>
      The moving average part models the current value using past errors.
      Instead of using past values directly, the MA part uses previous prediction errors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The parameter q specifies how many past errors are included.
    </p>

    <h2>Choosing p, d, and q</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing ARIMA parameters is an important step.
      Plots of the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function
      are often used to guide this choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to find a model that captures structure without overfitting noise.
    </p>

    <h2>Fitting an ARIMA model</h2>
    <p>
      Fitting an ARIMA model means estimating its parameters from data.
      This is usually done using maximum likelihood.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fitted model represents a balance between matching the data and keeping
      the model simple.
    </p>

    <h2>Model diagnostics</h2>
    <p>
      After fitting an ARIMA model, residuals should be examined.
      If the model is appropriate, residuals should look like uncorrelated noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Patterns in residuals suggest the model is missing structure.
      Diagnostics are essential before trusting forecasts.
    </p>

    <h2>Forecasting</h2>
    <p>
      ARIMA models are often used for forecasting.
      Forecasts are more reliable over short time horizons.
      Uncertainty increases quickly when predicting far into the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Limits of ARIMA models</h2>
    <p>
      ARIMA models work well for many types of data, but they have limits.
      They assume linear relationships and may not capture complex periodic signals
      or nonstationary behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      In astronomy, ARIMA is often one tool among many.
