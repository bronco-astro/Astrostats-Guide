    <p>
      Probability is used to describe likelyhood in astronomy and physics.
      Instruments have limitatioins, so noise is always present. Because of this, probability
      is used to describe what is known and how uncertain we are.
    </p>

    <h2>Uncertainty and observations</h2>
    <p>
      Astronomical data always contain uncertainty and errors. This uncertainty can come
      from measurement errors, systemic errors, limited observing time, or physical processes
      that cannot be fully observed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Probability does not describe randomness in nature itself. Instead tt explains
      how well we are confident about certain information. A situation may be deterministic in
      principle, but uncertain in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Probability rules</h2>
    <p>
      Probability values have some basic rules. Probability values are never
      negative. The total probability over all possible outcomes is one.
    </p>

    <p>
      These rules allow probability to work as a consistent mathematical system that we can calculate.
    </p>

    <h2>Conditional probability</h2>
    <p>
      Probability often changes when new information reveals. Conditional
      probability describes how likelihood changes when additional information
      is available.
    </p>

    <p>
      In astronomy, observations are often affected by detection limits and
      selection effects. Therefore, conditional probability take place.
    </p>

    <h2>Bayes’ theorem</h2>
    <p>
      Bayes’ theorem connects prior knowledge with new data. It provides a rule
      for updating conclusion after measurements are made.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea is to start with an initial hypothesis, compare it with observed
      data, and update the expectation using the data.
    </p>

    <h2>Random variables and measurements</h2>
    <p>
      Measurements are represented using random variables. A random variable
      assigns numerical values to uncertain quantities such as brightness,
      distance, velocity, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some variables might be discrete, while others vary
      continuously.
    </p>

    <h2>Probability distributions</h2>
    <p>
      Probability distributions describe how likely different values of a
      measurement are. A distribution can be described using a cumulative
      distribution function.
    </p>

    <p>
      For continuous measurements, probabilities are assigned to a certain range of data rather
      than exact values.
    </p>

    <h2>Independence and assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      Many statistical methods assume measurements do not affect each other
      and essentially from the same underlying distribution. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Correlated data and time-dependent measurements doesn't use these
      assumptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Large-sample behaviour</h2>
    <p>
      When a number of measurements are collected, we can see a general pattern as averages
      tend to stabilize as more data are added.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sums of many independent measurements often follow a normal distribution,
      as designed by nature.
