    <p>
      Probability is used to describe uncertainty in astronomy and physics.
      Most measurements are not exact. Instruments have limits, observations
      are incomplete, and noise is always present. Because of this, probability
      is used to describe what is known and how uncertain that knowledge is.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even when a physical process follows strict laws, the outcome is treated
      as uncertain if all controlling factors cannot be measured. For example,
      photon counts from a telescope follow physical laws, but the exact number
      detected during an observation cannot be predicted ahead of time.
    </p>

    <h2>Uncertainty and observations</h2>
    <p>
      Astronomical data always contain uncertainty. This uncertainty can come
      from measurement errors, limited observing time, or physical processes
      that cannot be fully observed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Probability does not describe randomness in nature itself. It describes
      uncertainty in human knowledge. A situation may be deterministic in
      principle, but uncertain in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Probability rules</h2>
    <p>
      Probability values follow a few basic rules. Probability values are never
      negative. The total probability over all possible outcomes equals one.
      When outcomes cannot occur together, their probabilities add.
    </p>

    <p>
      These rules allow probability to work as a consistent mathematical system.
    </p>

    <h2>Conditional probability</h2>
    <p>
      Probability often changes when new information is known. Conditional
      probability describes how likelihood changes once additional information
      is available.
    </p>

    <p>
      In astronomy, observations are often affected by detection limits and
      selection effects. Conditional probability is used to account for these
      conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Bayes’ theorem</h2>
    <p>
      Bayes’ theorem connects prior knowledge with new data. It provides a rule
      for updating beliefs after measurements are made.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea is to start with an initial expectation, compare it with observed
      data, and update the expectation using the data.
    </p>

    <h2>Random variables and measurements</h2>
    <p>
      Measurements are represented using random variables. A random variable
      assigns numerical values to uncertain quantities such as brightness,
      distance, velocity, or photon counts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some variables take only whole-number values, while others vary
      continuously.
    </p>

    <h2>Probability distributions</h2>
    <p>
      Probability distributions describe how likely different values of a
      measurement are. A distribution can be described using a cumulative
      distribution function or a density function.
    </p>

    <p>
      For continuous measurements, probabilities are assigned to ranges rather
      than exact values.
    </p>

    <h2>Independence and assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      Many statistical methods assume measurements do not influence each other
      and come from the same underlying distribution. These assumptions simplify
      analysis but are not always valid in astronomy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Correlated data and time-dependent measurements often violate these
      assumptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Large-sample behavior</h2>
    <p>
      When many measurements are collected, regular patterns appear. Averages
      tend to stabilize as more data are added.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sums of many independent measurements often follow a normal distribution,
      even when the original data do not.
