    <p>Chapter 10 — Censored and Truncated Data</p>
  </header>

  <main>

    <p>
      This chapter is about data that are incomplete because of observational limits.
      In astronomy, this happens very often. Instruments have detection limits,
      and surveys have selection rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      Censored and truncated data require special treatment.
      Using standard statistical methods without accounting for these effects
      can lead to biased results.
    </p>

    <h2>Why incomplete data appear</h2>
    <p>
      Astronomical observations are limited by sensitivity.
      Some objects are too faint to be detected, while others are only partially measured.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dataset does not represent the full underlying population.
      Understanding how data are missing is the first step.
    </p>

    <h2>Censoring versus truncation</h2>
    <p>
      Censoring and truncation describe different situations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Censoring means an object is observed, but its value is not fully known.
      An upper limit is measured instead of an exact value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Truncation means objects are completely missing from the dataset
      if they fall outside some range.
    </p>

    <p>
      This distinction matters because it changes how analysis is done.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of censoring</h2>
    <p>
      Right censoring occurs when values above a threshold are unknown.
      Left censoring occurs when values below a threshold are unknown.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interval censoring occurs when values are only known to lie within a range.
      Upper limits are a common form of censoring in astronomy.
    </p>

    <h2>Problems with ignoring censoring</h2>
    <p>
      If censored data are treated as exact values or discarded,
      statistical estimates become biased.
    </p>

    <p>
      Means, correlations, and regression slopes can be strongly distorted,
      especially when faint objects are ignored.
    </p>

    <h2>Survival analysis ideas</h2>
    <p>
      Many methods for censored data come from survival analysis.
      These methods treat limits explicitly instead of ignoring them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Survival analysis was originally developed for time-to-event data
      but applies naturally to astronomical measurements.
    </p>

    <h2>The Kaplan–Meier estimator</h2>
    <p>
      The Kaplan–Meier estimator is used to estimate distributions with censored data.
      It builds a stepwise estimate of the cumulative distribution function
      while accounting for censored observations.
    </p>

    <p>
      This method allows both detected values and limits to be included.
    </p>

    <h2>Comparing censored samples</h2>
    <p>
      Comparing samples that contain censoring requires special tests.
      Rank-based tests have versions that handle censored data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ignoring censoring in comparisons can lead to incorrect conclusions.
    </p>

    <h2>Regression with censored data</h2>
    <p>
      Regression becomes more complicated when the response variable is censored.
      Ordinary least squares does not apply directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Likelihood-based methods are commonly used instead.
    </p>

    <h2>Maximum likelihood approaches</h2>
    <p>
      Maximum likelihood provides a natural framework for censored and truncated data.
      The likelihood includes contributions from both detected values and limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      This allows all available information to be used.
    </p>

    <h2>Truncated data</h2>
    <p>
      In truncated samples, some objects are completely missing.
      For example, a flux-limited survey only includes objects brighter
      than a detection threshold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Objects below the threshold never appear in the dataset.
    </p>

    <h2>Methods for truncated data</h2>
    <p>
      Analysis of truncated data requires modeling the selection process.
      Likelihood functions are conditioned on objects being observed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This correction accounts for missing objects and reduces bias.
    </p>

    <h2>Astronomical examples</h2>
    <p>
      Censored and truncated data appear in luminosity functions,
      flux measurements, and survey catalogs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Proper treatment of limits and selection effects is essential
      for reliable scientific conclusions.
    </p>

    <h2>Limits of these methods</h2>
    <p>
      These methods rely on assumptions about censoring and truncation mechanisms.
      If assumptions are wrong, results can still be biased.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding the observational process is essential.
